This util transforms a cucumber example table into a yaml example table used by
plain junit tests.
The script expects two parameters:
1. The file containing cucumber example table
2. The name of the output file that would contain the result.
The output file will be automatically created
Just copy the output contents and paste it into your yaml source.
