The following is the script that automatically generates the test data for the
identity database. It takes the info about the number of each entities as well as the
database url from the config.yaml file. The data gets automatically inserted
into the database without the intermediate database restore step. The identity
database must exist and be migrated to the actual schema version.

In order for the script to work, please:
1. install epel-release: yum install epel-release -y
2. install python-pip package (dnf install python-pip -y)
3. install gcc, mariadb-devel, python-devel
4. execute the following command prior to the first script execution to install
all dependencies: "pip install -r requirements.txt"

PLEASE NOTE: The above steps apply if you have CentOS. For other linux
distributions package names may differ

The default config.yaml makes the script to create a really huge database with:
200000 users
12000 customers
60000 properties
6000 property sets
2000 applications
6000 application versions
24000 commercial subscriptions, etc
The script takes it's time to perform the task (~ 20 min) and consumes considerable amount
of RAM at some point - up to 2Gb. Be aware of that.

At the exit the script generates the test_data.txt file that contains the valid
user_id and application_version_id to be used for REST requests. The user has a
role with the context application that enables him to see all endpoints. Also
the context app has permissions to see all endpoints. Note that the user does
not have password set, so you need to set his password in order to use the
authorization workflow.
After the performance tests are finished it is generally a good idea to clean
the database of the test data. This is done by executing the contents of
cleanup.sql in a db session.
