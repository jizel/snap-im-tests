The image is built using the following command:
"docker build -t image_name ."
You need to mount the operations/docker_shared folder as /data volume of the
builder container.
Something like this would do:
docker run -v path_to/operations/docker_shared:/data image_name
The artifacts will then be found in the operations/docker_shared/modules
